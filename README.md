# Cricket Team Image Gallery

A simple responsive image gallery showcasing famous cricket players with cool CSS hover transformations.

## Overview

This project displays a collection of cricket player images, each demonstrating different CSS transform effects on hover, such as translate, rotate, scale, skew, and more.

The gallery is built with:

- **HTML**: Structure of the page and image containers.
- **CSS**: Styling and hover effects with smooth transitions and shadows.
- **Responsive layout**: Uses flexbox to align images nicely on different screen sizes.

## Features

- **Hover animations** on each image demonstrating different CSS transforms:
  - TranslateX
  - Rotate (2D and 3D)
  - ScaleX and ScaleY
  - SkewX and SkewY
  - Matrix transformation
  - Border radius change (circle effect)
  - Hide image on hover (disappear effect)

- Stylish design with black borders and shadow effects to highlight images.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure the folder structure is maintained:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `images/` (with all player images)
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser to view the gallery.
4. Hover over each image to see the transformation effects.

## How It Works

- Each `.image-box` container wraps an image and a title.
- On hover, different CSS `transform` properties are applied with smooth 2-second transitions.
- The background color is a soft purple (#D8BFD8), while the images and borders use black and white for contrast.
